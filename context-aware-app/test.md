中文：英伟达三季度业绩与指引均显著超出市场预期，证伪了此前关于AI资本开支见顶的担忧。随着Blackwell架构产能逐步爬坡、新客户持续加入以及主权级AI需求的共振，数据中心业务有望保持强劲增长。四季度指引同样亮眼，英伟达盘后股价大涨逾6%，市场对“泡沫论”的质疑得到有力回应。当前阶段，海外算力链相关机会值得关注。


NVIDIA's third-quarter performance and guidance significantly exceeded market expectations, dispelling previous concerns about the peak of AI capital expenditure. With the gradual ramp-up of Blackwell architecture production capacity, the continuous addition of new customers, and the resonance of sovereign-level AI demand, the data center business is expected to maintain strong growth. The fourth-quarter guidance is equally impressive, with NVIDIA's after-hours stock price surging over 6%, providing a strong response to market skepticism about the "bubble theory." At this stage, opportunities related to the overseas computing power chain are worth paying attention to.

总结：NVIDIA's strong Q3 results and outlook surpassed expectations, easing concerns about AI spending peaking. Driven by Blackwell production scaling, new customers, and sovereign AI demand, its data center business is poised for sustained growth. Q4 guidance is robust, boosting the stock over 6% after-hours and countering bubble fears, highlighting opportunities in the overseas computing power chain.
